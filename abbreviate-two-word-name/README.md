Write a function to convert a name into initials. This kata strictly takes two words with one space in between them.

The output should be two capital letters with a dot seperating them.

It should look like this:

Sam Harris => S.H

Patrick Feeney => P.F

WE had to split the string at the space and hten return a concatinated string with first letter of word in the array capitalized with a period in between.
